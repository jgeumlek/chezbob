This directory contains two barcode servers (daemons):
 - a drop-in replacement of barcoded/barcodeid from bob2k14 (barcode_server.py)
 - a similar server using crossbar/wamp, used by espresso (barcode_server_wamp.py)

The barcode scanner supports:
 - Serial barcode scanners (like the one bolted to the soda machine)
 - HID (keyboard-emulating) barcode scanners (like main term's and espresso's)
 - NFC readers

NFC readers are a hack. It only runs under python2.7 because the NFC library
didn't support python3 as of writing. We present the NFC tag's serial number of
(prepended with "NFC:") as a barcode. Everwhere else sees NFC tags as barcodes.
