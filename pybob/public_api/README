This is the API that's exposed at /api on the public web.

Rather confusingly, as of this writing, this code is running under python2.7
while (almost) everything else is python3.

The biggest reason for this (other than the server is out of date) is that
the ancient version of django that we're running is written for python2.7.

This means that we can't use most of the other helper modules we've assembled
in the parent directory.

Since this grew organically, there are several duplicates in this directory.
A TODO is to move everything to python3.

It probably leaks data that we don't want to leak. Another good TODO is to
decide whether we want to remove some of this functionality, or at a minimum,
add rate limiting.
