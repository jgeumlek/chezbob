<!--<h1>Current Maintainers of the Co-op</h1>

<p>Chez Bob is a pretty big job these days.  So, we have a group of
dedicated folks helping out.  The list of current and past Chez Bob
Gurus is on the
<a href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/groups/csegsa/jobs.html#lounge">CSE-GSA
jobs page</a>.  The current gurus (as of 2006) are:</p>

<h1>History</h1>

<p>This is an organization with a rich history and steeped in culture.
OK, maybe not, but you wouldn't be at this page unless you were at least
a little interested, so here goes.</p>

<tr>
  <td>c. 1988</td>
  <td>The <b>CCCP</b> (<b>C</b>offee and <b>C</b>andy
    <b>C</b>o-o<b>P</b>) was formed by Sue Merritt and Jim Mattson.
    Roughly 6 different brands of soda, 6 different types of candy bars,
    and coffee (all from Costco) were orignially stocked.  Weekly
    resupply trips were made with Sue's Toyota Corolla as the vehicle of
    choice.  At this point, the grad lounge didn't even exist!  The
    co-op operated in 3218, then the department library, using a
    makeshift <a href="images/lockbox.jpg">lockbox</a> epoxied to a
    table.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>1990(?)</td>
  <td>After a brief period during which it was unclear who ran the
    co-op, Robert Bowdidge and Bob Carragher took on the responsibility
    of the co-op, vowing to breathe life back into the empty co-op.
    Shortly thereafter, Eric Anderson joined the pair to ensure the
    co-op's survival.  The new vehicle of choice: a 1978 Chevy Impala.
    With the new leadership came a
    <a href="chezbob_articles/v2.6/uptime.html">new name</a>: <b>Chez
    Bob.</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>1991</td>
  <td>The allocation of the current grad student lounge, in combination
    with the enthusiasm of the new management ensuring an uninterrupted
    flow of empty calories into department members' happy stomachs.
    Everyone rejoiced.  Yay!</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>1991-1995</td>
  <td>Under the watchful eye of Bob Carragher and Eric Anderson, Chez
    Bob became a fixture of the CSE Department.  During this period, the
    folks who ran Chez Bob discovered the Costco would deliver shipments
    of sufficiently large size.  The selection of goods steadily
    expanded to include more snacks, more drinks, and frozen foods, and
    spending topped $1000 each month.  A recent excavation effort
    yielded <A HREF=images/old_door.jpg>a piece of a vintage Chez Bob
    cabinet</A>, which our advanced artifact dating techniques have
    shown probably originated from this era.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>1995-1997</td>
  <td>Darren Atkinson, Jeremy Sussman, and Chris Vogt all had a hand in
    running Chez Bob during this period.  Capstone achievements during
    these expansion-minded years included:
    <ul>
      <li>the introduction of food with real nutritional value (bananas,
      apples, yogurt, etc.)</li>
      <li>a <a href="images/freezer.jpg"><i>big</i> freezer</a> for a
      substantial store of frozen food</li>
      <li>the second lounge microwave</li>
      <li>more parties!</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>1997-1998</td>
  <td>Paul Blair and Adam Taylor ran Chez Bob.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Summer 1998</td>
  <td>Alan Su began running Chez Bob.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>March 26, 1999</td>
  <td>On this date, the first version of <b>B.o.B. 2k</b> (Bank of Bob
    2000) was deployed in the grad lounge, using an AMD K6 233MHz linux
    machine.  The initial version of the software was a single Perl
    script making calls to the <code>dialog</code>(1) command line
    utility for creating user interfaces.  Balance information is stored
    in a PostgreSQL database.  Thanks to CSEHelp (for the machine) and
    the UCSD GSA (for the monitor).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>September 21, 1999</td>
  <td>Having more or less successfully weaned the department's current
    users of the system from the legacy
    <a href="images/cards.jpg">“index card” accounting system</a>, all
    Chez Bob users were now proud owners of B.o.B. 2K accounts.
    Students, staff, and faculty who joined the department after this
    date have never had the joy of tracking their co-op balance on cute
    little colored index cards.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>September, 2000</td>
  <td>Sadly, the initial chezbob.ucsd.edu machine became unstable, due
    to a combination of a failing disk and bad memory.  So,
    chezbob.ucsd.edu was “upgraded” to a Pentium 90 MHz linux machine
    with 64 MB of memory.  As of 9/1/2002, this is the current
    configuration.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Spring 2001</td>
  <td>An intrepid CSE 210 (Software Engineering) group consisting of
    Michael Copenhafer, Wesley Leong, Seth Delackner, Cuong Pham, and
    Yunfeng Fei decided that the existing Chez Bob interface, in concept
    and implementation, lacked purity.  Together with the Chez Bob
    management and Prof. Bill Griswold, this group of students set out
    to change the face of Chez Bob.  Aside from greatly improving the
    readability and maintainability of the code, a barcode reader was
    added to the system, and a sound card and speech synthesizer was
    included to give Chez Bob a <a href="bob.wav">voice</a>.  Finally,
    an innovative <a href="http://chezbob.ucsd.edu/">web interface</a>
    was added.  This system was dubbed <b>B.o.B. 2001</b>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Spring 2001</td>
  <td>Concurrent with the new B.o.B. 2001 system, the job of running
    Chez Bob was formally split into several roles and incorporated into
    the <a href="http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/groups/csegsa/">CSE Graduate
    Student Association</a>.  With the help of the CSEGSA, Chez Bob
    should continue to flourish and provide the department with
    research-inducing food and beverage.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>2001?</td>
  <td>Chez Bob has over 200 active users and moves roughly $1500 in
    food, drink, and candy per month.  We continue to
    <a href="chezbob_articles/v4.9/party.html">help fund parties</a>,
    buy food for poor comps-takers, and hopefully make life in our
    department that much more enjoyable!</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>2006</td>
  <td>Chez Bob continues to thrive, despite a lack of web page updates.
    With the move to the new Computer Science building, Chez Bob is
    established in the new grad student lounge (but pictures on this
    site are probably wrong right now).  In other news, a separate but
    partially overlapping group works to build a biometric soda machine
    that integrates into the Chez Bob account system.  Watch this space
    for more updates!</td>

CSEHelp Uptime newsletter which was published when Chez Bob was first
formed.  The articles which reference Chez Bob (or its precursor, the
CCCP) are archived <a href="chezbob_articles">here</a>.  This history
